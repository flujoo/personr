`launch_test()` will open a personality test in your browser, and generate a report after you submit your responses.

The test used is from <https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/>, which is a popular, science-based personality test.

In your report, your test results are compared with other people's data, to show what your results mean. Other people's data is from <https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/BIG5.zip>.
